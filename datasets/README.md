## CT-ORG Dataset

This project uses the public **CT-ORG** dataset provided by *The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)*.

The dataset is used **exclusively for the experimental benchmarks**, as the initial Marching Cubes implementation is computationally too slow to reconstruct all meshes.

Dataset URL:  
https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/ct-org/

Due to its size and licensing constraints, the dataset is **not included** in this repository.
